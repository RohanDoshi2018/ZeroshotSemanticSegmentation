# PASCAL VOC and SBD

The PASCAL VOC 2011 dataset contains semantic segmentation annotations for a 2223 image subset (1112 train and 1111 val).

The Semantic Boundary Dataset (SBD) offers further annotation of PASCAL VOC 2011 (~5x increase), with 11318 images divided into 8498 train and 2820 val images (splits do not match PASCAL VOC 2011).

Train: 8498 images from SBD's train split
Val: 735 image subset of PASCAL VOC 2011 val split (after ignoring intersections with SBD's train/val split); this is also the official "test" split in SBD.
